          <div id='textBox'>
            <p class='aboutUsText'>Our aim with Bonnie is to help address the current Coronavirus crisis and the consequences that it inevitably brings. Given the nationwide lockdown that has been imposed, we hope that some form of interactability will be a welcome change from receiving static google answers. Furthermore, we aim to quickly and easily provide information and advice in one place so that you don't have to go trawling through the web. </p>
